## Crop Recommendation System
This project, developed using Python in Jupyter Notebook, implements machine learning algorithms to provide accurate crop recommendations based on environmental and soil conditions. By analyzing various input parameters, the system helps farmers make informed decisions to improve agricultural efficiency and sustainability.

**Machine Learning Model**: The project uses a Random Forest classifier, which analyzes data such as soil pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other environmental variables to recommend suitable crops.

**Data Sources**: We used publicly available datasets from sources like the Department of Agriculture and open datasets from Kaggle, containing detailed soil and climate data for different regions in India.

**Features Used**: The system considers various key factors such as soil pH, rainfall levels, average temperature, and humidity to suggest crops that are optimal for the given conditions.

**Impact and Applications**: This project can help farmers increase productivity, reduce resource wastage, and support sustainable agriculture by providing data-driven recommendations. Itâ€™s also scalable and adaptable to different geographical regions.

**Future Improvements**: Future plans include integrating more complex climate forecasting models, incorporating real-time weather data, and expanding the recommendation system to a broader range of crops and regions.

Developed by **Mehul** and **Maanas**, this project is designed to bridge the gap between traditional farming methods and modern data-driven agriculture.
